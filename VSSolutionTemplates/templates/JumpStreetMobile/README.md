# What is JumpStreetMobile?
JumpStreetMobile is an application accelerator for Azure App Service Mobile Apps.

The accelerator is captured in a Visual Studio project template that you can use to create a full-featured cross platform Azure mobile app that features:
* Traditional "File | New Project" approach for an entirely Visual Studio creation experience, no portal configuration required
* Generated app is ready to run with all these key mobile app capabilities completely integrated:
	* Cross platform client apps (iOS, Android, Windows UWP, Win 8.1, Win 8.1 Phone)
	* Offline data sync with conflict resolution
	* Modern authentication (Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google, Azure Active Directory)
	* Push notifications (Apple, Google, Windows, Amazon, Baidu (Android China))
	* ARM Template means your solution is DevOps ready and service creation can be done in Visual Studio
* Application capabilities can be turned on or off individually by simple configuration rather than requiring a coding exercise
	* Offline Sync
	* Authentication
	*Push Notifications

Unlike the current Quickstart in the Azure portal, there is no need to reinvent the wheel with each new mobile app which requires tedious and error-prone copy & paste construction from the Azure Mobile app documentation.
 
Use it as the starting point for your next mobile app or as a 
sample app that shows how all the major features of 
Azure App Service Mobile Apps are integrated

# To Try It
Get the latest vsix from [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sayedihashimi/vssolutiontemplates/build/artifacts)
**Important!!!**  The template will download as a .zip so you will have to rename it to .vsix
