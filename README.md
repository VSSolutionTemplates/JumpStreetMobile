# VSSolutionTemplates
VSSolutionTemplates are large grained solution accelerators.  They take the form of Visual Studio project templates
that generate Visual Studio Solutions consisting of multiple integrated sub-projects.  These sub-projects have been
specifically designed to create a holistic soluion baseline that can be used as-is or customized and extended to
quickly tailor a given solution to the needs of a particual application.  The difference between VSSoluitonTemplates
and more traditional project templates is the aspect of scale.  VSSolutionTemplates tend to be large grained and
often include ARM templates that both describe and deploy the end solution.
